Just holler if you need anything, alright? We'll get Dr. Chen in to see you again after lunch.\n\n(I pat her hand gently and head out into the hallway, making a quick note on my clipboard. I'm trying to remember to slow down, be more present with each patient. It's so easy to get caught up in the rush. Speaking of rushing... )\n\nThirty-three. That was my milestone recently. Thirty-three years on this planet. Honestly, I'd almost forgotten it was happening! Working here, time just... disappears.\n\nHow did I celebrate? Well, it was pretty low-key, to be honest. After a particularly brutal shift the night before \u2013 a nasty car accident kept us all hopping \u2013 I thought I'd be too tired to do anything. But my best friend, Sarah, knows me too well. She dragged me out for brunch at Mildred's Temple Kitchen down by Liberty Village. We devoured their blueberry buttermilk pancakes (seriously, they're heaven!) and just chatted for hours. Talked about everything and nothing, you know? Just the kind of girl time I desperately needed. \n\nThen, later that evening, my fianc\u00e9, Mark, surprised me with a small gathering at our place. My family was there, a few close friends... he even managed to get my grumpy Uncle George to crack a smile. He baked my favourite chocolate cake (Mark is a fantastic baker!), and we just laughed and reminisced. \n\nIt wasn't a wild party or anything extravagant, but it was perfect. It felt... real. After the chaos and intensity of this job, being surrounded by the people I love, celebrating the simple things \u2013 that's exactly what I wanted. Turning thirty-three felt less like a big, scary milestone and more like a comfortable step into another chapter. A chapter filled with love, good friends, and hopefully, making a difference, one patient at a time.\n",

This reunion digitization...it's important to Mom and Dad. They've been talking about this reunion for months, and reliving these old memories will be so special for everyone, especially Grandma.\n\nRight, the tapes. Okay, so I found a few old Hi8 tapes while helping Aunt Susan go through the boxes. Early childhood stuff \u2013 probably me smearing pureed peas all over my face and singing off-key into a toy microphone. Still, gotta get them converted! The deadline is next week? That\u2019s\u2026tight.\n\nAlright, options:\n\n1.  **Do it myself:** Ugh. I vaguely remember Dad having some kind of converter thingy packed away in the basement. But finding it, figuring out how to use it, and then dedicating the time\u2026on top of my shifts this week? That's going to be brutal. Probably mean late nights and running on fumes.\n\n2.  **Outsource it:** There\u2019s gotta be a place that can do this quickly. I\u2019ll Google \"video conversion Toronto\" during my lunch break. A professional service would likely do a better job anyway, and faster. Plus, I can support a local business.\n\n3.  **Delegate (aka guilt trip a sibling):** My brother, Liam, is usually good with tech stuff. Maybe I could subtly remind him how much Grandma loves him, and how much this reunion means to her... Nah, that feels a little manipulative. Plus, Liam's swamped with work himself.\n\nOkay, deep breaths, again. Option 2 is the most sensible. I'll research reputable places online. Check their reviews, turnaround time, and prices. I'll call them during my break to confirm they can meet the deadline. If the price is too high, then I\u2019ll reluctantly dive into Dad's basement and dust off that converter.\n\nUltimately, making this reunion a success for the family is top of mind. And, as much as I am committed to my family, I have to find a realistic way to balance it with my responsibilities here at the hospital. Patients first, then family, then sleep (maybe). Time to get back to work; those charts aren't going to fill themselves.\n",

Or, you know, where my friends' kids are aiming to go!\n\nSo, if you're talking the absolute *top* universities in the Toronto area, everyone knows it's:\n\n1.  **University of Toronto (U of T):** I mean, duh. It's got a stellar reputation, practically world-renowned. It's tough to get into, but for a good reason. I've met quite a few amazing doctors who graduated from there. They're doing some groundbreaking research too, especially with my field of medicine.\n\n2.  **York University:** It's always been a front-runner, but lately it has been making some serious moves. Some people swear by it, and they seem to offer programs U of T doesn't. So definitely a solid choice, with a strong reputation that is growing.\n\n3.  **Toronto Metropolitan University:** It's becoming a really important academic presence, and they're known for having great placement rates for some of their programs.\n\nAnd listen, I know there are some fantastic colleges around here too, like Seneca and George Brown. If I wanted to do something practical or get some specialized training, they'd be right at the top of my list. But you asked about *universities*, so those are the ones that first come to mind!

That's usually doable, even with Toronto traffic, but with this playoff madness\u2026 nope. Not gonna risk it.\n\nFirst things first, I grab my phone and fire off a quick text to Dr. Chen at the clinic. \"Dr. Chen, this is Maya Sharma. Running late due to unexpected downtown gridlock. Leafs playoff game causing havoc! Will call when closer, but expect at least 30 mins delay. So sorry!\" Hit send. At least they're in the loop.\n\nOkay, options. Option A: brave the traffic and pray. Not feeling lucky today. Option B: subway. That's probably the fastest bet, but getting to the nearest station... and this clipboard definitely isn\u2019t subway-friendly.\n\nOption C\u2026 I could call a Lyft and pray for a driver willing to brave the madness and knows some back roads. It\u2019s risky, but potentially faster than the subway with transfers.\n\nAlright, deep breath. Lyft it is. I open the app, set my destination, and hold my breath. Bingo! A driver named \"Aisha\" is 7 minutes away. Hallelujah! I quickly text Dr. Chen again. \"Lyft on the way, Aisha knows the backstreets. Hopefully less delayed! Will update ETA as soon as I have one. So sorry again!\"\n\nNow, time to hustle. I grab my purse, double-check I have everything, and practically power-walk towards the hospital entrance.

It's a whirlwind, that's for sure, but wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nFirst and foremost, my priority is always the patients. That means everything from taking their vitals and meticulously charting their progress, to administering medications and changing dressings. I'm the one who spends the most direct time with them, so I'm often the first to notice if something is amiss. A subtle change in their breathing, a slight shift in their pain level \u2013 I need to be on top of it all. So, I'm constantly observing, listening, and documenting.\n\nBeyond the hands-on stuff, a huge part of my job is communication. I need to be able to clearly explain complex medical information to patients and their families in a way they understand. It's no use rattling off jargon. I try to meet them where they are and be a source of comfort and reassurance, especially when they're scared or confused. This means a lot of answering questions, holding hands, and simply listening to their concerns.\n\nThen there\u2019s all the stuff behind the scenes. I'm working closely with the doctors, reporting on patient status, flagging any urgent issues, and carrying out their orders. I'm also coordinating with other departments \u2013 lab, pharmacy, physiotherapy, you name it \u2013 to ensure our patients receive coordinated care.\n\nAnd honestly, in a busy hospital like this one, you've gotta be flexible. You never know what the day will throw at you. There might be an emergency, a sudden influx of patients, or a staffing shortage. You have to be able to prioritize, adapt, and pitch in wherever you're needed.\n\nSo, yeah, that\u2019s the gist of it. A lot of responsibility, a lot of pressure, but ultimately, incredibly rewarding. Knowing I'm making a difference in people's lives, even in small ways, is what keeps me going. And hey, the view of the CN Tower from some of the rooms isn't bad either, a little reminder of the city we are working to keep healthy.\n",

How long has this been going on? Is it constant, or does it come and go? Does anything seem to trigger it, like standing up too quickly or eating certain foods? And has she noticed anything else, like blurred vision, nausea, or a racing heart?\n\n(I reach for my water, my mind already clicking into gear. This doesn't sound like a simple case of \"old age.\" There are a *million* things this could be, and Mr. Henderson brushing it off is honestly, a little worrying).\n\nOkay, Aunt Carol, listen. I really don\u2019t want to alarm you, but lightheadedness and dizziness, especially in someone Mrs. Henderson\u2019s age, can be a symptom of something serious. It could be anything from dehydration or low blood pressure to something more complex like an arrhythmia or even a medication side effect.\n\nI know Mr. Henderson is probably just trying to be practical, but she really, *really* needs to see a doctor. Ideally, a full physical with bloodwork and an EKG. Don't let him brush it off! Tell him I said that too. Tell him it's better to be safe than sorry. I know it can be a pain to go to the hospital or even a walk-in, but this is her health we're talking about.\n\n(I push my plate away slightly, my focus now entirely on Aunt Carol).\n\nListen, I\u2019m a bit biased, obviously, but if you're concerned, maybe offer to go with her to the appointment? Two heads are better than one, and you can help her remember to ask all the right questions. I\u2019m happy to give you a list of potential questions to ask her doctor beforehand, too. I could even, off the record, take a look at her bloodwork when they do it, if you can get me a copy.\n\nAunt Carol, this is important. Don't let Mr. Henderson just ignore this. I\u2019m saying this not just as your niece, but as someone who deals with situations like this every day. Please, promise me you\u2019ll encourage her to see a doctor.

The primary responsibilities... they're a lot, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. \n\nFirst and foremost, it's patient care. That's the heart of it all. Assessing their condition when they come in, taking vitals, reviewing their medical history \u2013 making sure I have a clear picture of what's going on. And then, of course, administering medications, wound care, and assisting the doctors with procedures. I need to be quick, observant, and ready to adapt because, let's be real, things can change in a heartbeat.\n\nDocumentation. Oh man, the documentation. It's essential, though. Every observation, every medication given, every interaction \u2013 it all has to be meticulously recorded. It's vital for continuity of care and legal reasons, naturally. I spend a fair amount of time on the computer, making sure everything's up-to-date.\n\nThen there's patient education. Explaining diagnoses, treatment plans, medication instructions\u2026 breaking down complicated medical jargon into something they can understand. I try to make sure they feel heard and empowered to take an active role in their health.\n\nAnd teamwork. I work alongside doctors, other nurses, allied health professionals \u2013 we're a team. Communicating clearly, supporting each other, and ensuring we're all on the same page is crucial. A good team makes all the difference in this environment. \n\nAnd I guess the last thing I would have to say would be, that you have to stay current. Medicine never stands still. New research, new technologies, new guidelines... I need to keep learning to provide the best possible care. Conferences, journals, in-services \u2013 it's a constant process of professional development.\n\nLooking at the CN Tower reminds me that even things that seem big and overwhelming can be tackled one step at a time. Like each patient, each task, each day. It's a privilege, really, to do this work.\n",

If not, I'll just have to deal with the consequences later, but there's nothing I can do right now. I change back into my regular clothes, grab my bag, and head for the subway. Wish me luck.\n",

Documenting everything accurately in the patient's chart is also crucial; if it's not written down, it didn't happen, right?

Can you guys handle that? And how much will it set me back?\"\n\nRegardless of who does it, I would make sure to confirm the timeline and the costs. No hidden fees or delays.
